# Starting the journey

What I learned in part 1 -

- Worlds Greatest Lie :
	``` It's this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of whats happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate." ```
- At that point in theeir lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their "Personal Legend".
